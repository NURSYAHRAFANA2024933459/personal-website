        <h3>Quiet Observation</h3>
        <p>
        You are not meant to be accepted by everyone, and Islam reminds us of this truth. Pleasing people is never the ultimate goal; pleasing Allah is. When you stop chasing validation, you find peace in your own lane.

    <div class="thought-box">
        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
        <p>
        Gratitude turns what we have into enough. A thankful heart sees blessings in the smallest details, and this perspective transforms ordinary days into extraordinary ones.

    <div class="thought-box">
        <h3>Resilience</h3>
        <p>
        Life will test you, but every challenge is a chance to grow stronger. Resilience is not about avoiding hardship, but about rising each time with more wisdom and faith.
